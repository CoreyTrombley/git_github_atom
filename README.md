### Github.com
**what is github?**
> GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

Github also developed a nice little GUI tool for all us non command line folk.
Download the version you need from one of these links
* [Github GUI mac](https://mac.github.com/)
* [Github GUI windows](https://windows.github.com/)
* [Other GUI tools](http://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux) _* If you are not running mac or windows os, sorry but github hates you. You can still download one of these other tools_
